As a practical matter, a Party may object to consolidation on policy grounds.  The Parties should note that not consolidating related Disputes in a single arbitration amplifies the claims risk for the Project Company which may have an adverse effect on the risk profile of the Project.  In any case, where consolidation cannot be accepted in one agreement it  is  still  beneficial  to  include the   in  all  other Project  Agreements where it can be accepted and the reference to the agreement that does not contain the consolidation  should not be omitted from the list contained in the consolidation is included in the remainder of the Project Agreements.\n\nOpen Solar Contracts v2.0.

"What law applies for issues such as court intervention in an arbitration, and why is it important to choose a country that is a signatory to the New York Convention?","As per Clause 22.5(d), the Governing Law shall also apply to this Clause 22.5 ( Arbitration ). 

This means that the law of the chosen country will govern issues such as court intervention in an arbitration. 

It is essential to choose a country that is a signatory to the New York Convention because it provides a framework for the recognition and enforcement of arbitral awards across borders. The New York Convention has been ratified by over 160 countries, making it a widely accepted and respected international treaty. By choosing a country that is a signatory to the New York Convention, the parties can ensure that their arbitral award will be recognized and enforced in other countries that are also signatories, thereby providing a high degree of certainty and predictability in the arbitration process.","['31\n- (b) The arbitration shall be conducted in the Arbitration Language.\n- (c) The seat or legal place of the arbitration shall be the Arbitration Seat.\n- (d) The Governing Law shall also apply to this Clause 22.5 ( Arbitration ).\n- (e) The Parties agree that the ICC Court and/or the arbitral tribunal (as applicable) may on request  from  either  Party,  consolidate  an  arbitration  commenced  hereunder  with  an arbitration or arbitrations commenced under the Implementation Agreement, the Supply Agreement, the Installation Agreement, the O&amp;M Agreement or any Finance Agreements 32 , if the arbitration proceedings raise common questions of law or fact.

Likewise, each Party agrees that it may be joined to any arbitration proceedings between the other Party and its counterparty under any of the aforementioned agreements to allow for the resolution in a single arbitration of a related Dispute raising common questions of law or fact under this Agreement. 33\n\n30 User Note: If the Agreement includes this standard arbitration Clause, it should not include any other jurisdiction Clause. Arbitration is an alternative to court jurisdiction.\n\n31 User Note: The ICC Rules contain a presumption for a sole arbitrator, and the ICC Court usually appoints a sole arbitrator unless the Dispute is complex or of high value, which is assessed on request of either Party.  It is suggested to retain this wording in the interests of flexibility and of controlling the cost and time of any Dispute, however the Parties may prefer to stipulate either one or three arbitrators.\n\n32 User Note: The Grid Connection Agreement to be considered on a Project specific basis.\n\n33 User Note: In light of the limited resources of the Project Company and additional delay caused by resolving related Disputes in separate proceedings, the right to consolidate with other proceedings should typically be in the interests of all Parties.  As a practical matter, a Party may object to consolidation on policy grounds.  The Parties should note that not consolidating related Disputes in a single arbitration amplifies the claims risk for the Project Company which may have an adverse effect on the risk profile of the Project.  In any case, where consolidation cannot be accepted in one agreement it  is  still  beneficial  to  include the   in  all  other Project  Agreements where it can be accepted and the reference to the agreement that does not contain the consolidation  should not be omitted from the list contained in the consolidation is included in the remainder of the Project Agreements.\n\nOpen Solar Contracts v2.0.
