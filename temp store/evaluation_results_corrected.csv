Arbitration is an alternative to court jurisdiction.\n\n31 User Note: The ICC Rules contain a presumption for a sole arbitrator, and the ICC Court usually appoints a sole arbitrator unless the Dispute is complex or of high value, which is assessed on request of either Party.

As a practical matter, a Party may object to consolidation on policy grounds.  The Parties should note that not consolidating related Disputes in a single arbitration amplifies the claims risk for the Project Company which may have an adverse effect on the risk profile of the Project.  In any case, where consolidation cannot be accepted in one agreement it  is  still  beneficial  to  include the   in  all  other Project  Agreements where it can be accepted and the reference to the agreement that does not contain the consolidation  should not be omitted from the list contained in the consolidation is included in the remainder of the Project Agreements.\n\nOpen Solar Contracts v2.0.

Arbitration is an alternative to court jurisdiction.\n\n31 User Note: The ICC Rules contain a presumption for a sole arbitrator, and the ICC Court usually appoints a sole arbitrator unless the Dispute is complex or of high value, which is assessed on request of either Party.  It is suggested to retain this wording in the interests of flexibility and of controlling the cost and time of any Dispute, however the Parties may prefer to stipulate either one or three arbitrators.\n\n32 User Note: The Grid Connection Agreement to be considered on a Project specific basis.\n\n33 User Note: In light of the limited resources of the Project Company and additional delay caused by resolving related Disputes in separate proceedings, the right to consolidate with other proceedings should typically be in the interests of all Parties.  As a practical matter, a Party may object to consolidation on policy grounds.  The Parties should note that not consolidating related Disputes in a single arbitration amplifies the claims risk for the Project Company which may have an adverse effect on the risk profile of the Project.  In any case, where consolidation cannot be accepted in one agreement it  is  still  beneficial  to  include the   in  all  other Project  Agreements where it can be accepted and the reference to the agreement that does not contain the consolidation  should not be omitted from the list contained in the consolidation is included in the remainder of the Project Agreements.\n\nOpen Solar Contracts v2.0.
